He had only done a blood fat test, and said it was a full range test for all blood issues including STD issues. Other females I have talked to have had this happen where doctors did not really do full STD tests for years. Many germs do not leave symptoms that are easy to see until they hurt you badly. Early detection can mean life or death in health issues you do not want to know when you are half dead a problem was NOT just your imagination.

It's very helpful to be knowledgeable of what's going on inside my body especially given I take many supplements and have recently put more focus on nutrition. All my vitamin levels except one we're good, so happy to know my efforts to eat better and supplement have been mostly working! I'm still low on my vitamin D so definitely need to get more sunlight and continue supplementation."}]},{"product_name":"Women's Health Test","product_page_id":"5","average_rating":4.65,"native_review_count":493,"question_count":0,"rating_histogram":[10,8,23,63,389],"recommended_ratio":0.94,"review_count":493,"syndicated_review_count":0,"contents":[{"author":"Betsy","created_date":1717764260479,"headline":"I would buy again","location":"Michigan","rating":5,"comments":"Glad it gave me some insight"},{"author":"Sally","created_date":1717562503458,"headline":"Would not purchase agaon","location":"New Orleans","rating":1,"comments":"System to prick finger bruised my finger for days as well as my daughter.

I had a gut feeling so I decided to take an Everlywell health test. Turns out my doctor was wrong and I was able to learn that I'm low in certain hormones due to the help of Everlywell. Sent my results in and was able to get on correct medication to get back to normal. Since then I've taken another test and am healthy and happy. This helped me so much."},{"author":"Nikki","created_date":1716076559322,"headline":"Very clear and easy","location":"San Francisco, CA","rating":4,"comments":"Directions were very clear.

But the saliva collection was absurd- it took me over an hour for each tube( times four tubes) and can't eat or drink thirty min before, and they had to be spaced out every four hours. Then after I got the results the testosterone said elevated with the disclaimer tbat saliva is affected by shipping/ temps or something and that result may not be accurate. I don't have any symptoms resembling elevated T so I'm just letting it go. But yeah I should have just done the perimenopause test and the thyroid test - for a little cheaper. I strongly advise against the saliva collection component of this."},{"author":"Exam","created_date":1715985748812,"headline":"Little did I know","location":"Fallon,NV","rating":5,"comments":"Everlywell gives you insight on where to start when taking care of your health, the way you see fit.

The kit I ordered required blood and saliva samples taken at different times of the month. My only complaint is that the instructions for sample collection were written on two different pieces of paper, (collection protocol on one, and more detailed collection protocol on another), and unfortunately I only read the first one when it came time to collect the saliva sample, so I am concerned my results were not completely accurate. I just wish the more detailed instructions had been printed in both places. Otherwise, the turn around time was very fast and the process was user friendly."},{"author":"K","created_date":1710153904340,"headline":"Very detailed test.","location":"Missouri","rating":5,"comments":"Appreciated all of the details of this test and the links provided to explain any questions you may have."}]},{"product_name":"Food Sensitivity Test","product_page_id":"3","average_rating":4.7,"native_review_count":6934,"question_count":0,"rating_histogram":[41,58,304,1165,5366],"recommended_ratio":0.96,"review_count":6934,"syndicated_review_count":0,"contents":[{"author":"J","created_date":1724889980562,"headline":"Great","location":"A","rating":5,"comments":"Helped with inflammation"},{"author":"Tess","created_date":1723346322776,"headline":"Love everlywell","location":"Houstoh","rating":5,"comments":"Want to take more test - knowledge for our health is essential"},{"author":"Ka","created_date":1723316503569,"headline":"Awesome","location":"Mn","rating":5,"comments":"Awesome"},{"author":"Tabby","created_date":1721853551686,"headline":"This product has helped me.","location":"Huntsville, AL","rating":5,"comments":"I recommend this product, as it has helped me shape my diet in a way that helps my symptoms."},{"author":"Fe","created_date":1721681893157,"headline":"Fe","location":"Fe","rating":5,"comments":"Fe"},{"author":"Liv","created_date":1721277435410,"headline":"I would buy this again","location":"Murray Utah","rating":5,"comments":"It was great"},{"author":"Joan","created_date":1719675509996,"headline":"It helped determine skin issues","location":"Chicago,il","rating":5,"comments":"I always thought I had pimples on my arms due to getting bad.
